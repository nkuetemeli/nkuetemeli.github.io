Since April 2024, I have held a position as a research assistant for quantum computer vision at the University of Siegen in the [Computer Vision Group](https://www.vsa.informatik.uni-siegen.de) of [Prof. Dr. Michael Möller](https://sites.google.com/site/michaelmoellermath/), and I am co-supervised by [Dr. Vladislav Golyanik](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~golyanik/), head of the [4D and Quantum Computer Vision Group](https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de) at Max Planck Institute for Informatics.
I received my PhD on quantum algorithms for image processing and my Master in computational life science from the University of Luebeck, both under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Jan Lellmann](https://www.lellmann.net/work/).
I received my Bachelor in computer science from the University of Dschang, under the supervision of [Dr. Maurice Tchoupe Tchendji](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maurice-Tchoupe-Tchendji).

I specialize in quantum computing’s applications to image processing and computer vision. 
This involves developing quantum algorithms for a range of optimization problems, both combinatorial and non-combinatorial. 
Quantum computing offers a powerful solution to overcome challenges posed by non-convex energies, limited storage, and high computational demands, promising more accurate and cost-effective solutions for real-world problems.
